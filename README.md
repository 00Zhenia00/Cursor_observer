# Cursor_observer
Observer pattern project

Implement a console application that:
- Prints "hello world" (or any other text) in the console.
- and monitors mouse movement:
When the cursor enters the console window area, the color of the text in the console
changes, and the current time is written to the log file with the "Enter" tag.
When the cursor leaves the console window area, the text color in the console
changes to the original color and the current time is written to the log file with the "Leave" tag.

Use the Observer pattern.
